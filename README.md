starting point for portfolio


This is my code for working on my professional web developer portfolio.  Clearly my "starting point" code is not the actual point
I started from but just when I decided to start uploading to GitHub on a regular basis.

If you would like to give me any pointers that would be awesome.

If you'd like to add in a feature on a new branch then you're the best!

Thnaks for viewing in any case :D
